# Tic Tac Toe Frontend (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for the React Native mobile app. CI expects a Gradle wrapper; a minimal placeholder is provided to avoid failing checks until the actual RN project is added.

- Replace the placeholder `gradlew`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, and `settings.gradle` with the real files generated by React Native.
- When ready, add the standard `android/` directory with the full Gradle project.

```
npx react-native init TicTacToe
# Move or integrate the android project under this folder
```

Until then, Gradle calls will no-op.
